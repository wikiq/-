Hello guys, if you are preparing for Coding interviews and looking for the **best System design courses** then you have come to the right place. System design is one of the most difficult topics and many candidates fail to answer questions related to system design, scalability, load-balancing, and failover, which are key to passing the interview.

I have been sharing useful courses for coding interviews for quite some time like earlier, I have shared [**best algorithms courses**](https://medium.com/javarevisited/7-best-courses-to-learn-data-structure-and-algorithms-d5379ae2588), [SQL courses](https://medium.com/hackernoon/top-5-sql-and-database-courses-to-learn-online-48424533ac61), [Dynamic Programming](https://medium.com/javarevisited/6-best-dynamic-programming-courses-for-coding-interviews-14744060923c), and [Linux courses](https://medium.com/javarevisited/top-10-courses-to-learn-linux-command-line-in-2020-best-and-free-f3ee4a78d0c0) for programmers, and today, I am going to talk about the best online courses to master System design for interviews.

These system design courses have been chosen from popular online learning platforms and websites like [Udemy](https://medium.com/javarevisited/10-best-udemy-online-courses-for-java-developers-4c9ab70cd01f), [Coursera](https://medium.com/javarevisited/18-coursera-courses-you-can-join-in-2020-to-learn-from-the-worlds-top-tech-companies-google-74af46967d1e), [edX](https://medium.com/javarevisited/10-free-best-edx-certifications-and-courses-to-learn-online-3473d466f968), and [Educative](https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2020/05/top-10-educative-courses-for-programmers.html) and these are created by experts who have seen the interviews from both sides of the table.

Along the way, I have also shared useful System Design YouTube videos where you can learn about some [popular system design questions](https://medium.com/javarevisited/25-software-design-interview-questions-to-crack-any-programming-and-technical-interviews-4b8237942db0) like Parking Lot and designing a Messenger service like Whatsapp or WeChat for FREE.

System design interviews are very common in tech giants and FAANG companies like Facebook, Amazon, Apple, NetFlix, and Google. They are different from [coding interviews](https://medium.com/javarevisited/20-binary-tree-algorithms-problems-from-coding-interviews-c5e5a384df30) or [data structure and algorithm interviews](https://medium.com/hackernoon/50-data-structure-and-algorithms-interview-questions-for-programmers-b4b1ac61f5b0) but can be harder.

These online courses will help you to learn useful skills to crack system design interviews at tech companies like Google, Uber, and other FAANG companies.

Without wasting any more of your time, here is my list of some of the great, interactive, and fun online courses to learn Software design and Architecture. These are truly the best online courses you can join to learn this essential skill or improve your system design skill.

1. [Mastering the System Design Interview By Frank Kane](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=JVFxdTr9V80&mid=39197&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fcourse%2Fsystem-design-interview-prep%2F) [Udemy]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you are looking for an Udemy course to prepare for System Design then you should look no further than this System design interview course by Frank Kane, an ex-Amazon hiring manager.

In this course, Frank has shared his first-hand experience with how to tackle System design questions on FAANG interviews. You will not only learn all the tips, concepts, and approaches to solve system design questions but also practice many classic System design problems like URL shorter, Web Crawler, and Designing a Restaurant reservation system.

Here are the key things you will learn in this 5-hour long System design course:

2. [Grokking the System Design Interview](https://www.educative.io/collection/5668639101419520/5649050225344512?affiliate_id=5073518643380224) [Educative]
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is one of my favorite courses when it comes to learning Software Design or System design. It’s created to prepare you for the System design interview, but you can also use it to learn how to approach System design in general.

The [_Grokking the System Design Interview_](https://www.educative.io/collection/5668639101419520/5649050225344512?affiliate_id=5073518643380224)_,_ is one of the first courses (or book) that describes the Large Scale Distributed System Design problems in detail. Even if you’ve worked on Distributed Systems before, there are a lot of things that you can learn from this course.

The authors have created this course to provide you with design choices(including pros and cons) so that you can understand the requirement, compare approaches, and come up with the best solution for the problem at hand.

They are also mindful not to provide a solution at a granularity that’s appropriate for a 45-minute discussion. This makes the course very interesting

Even if you are not preparing for [Coding interviews](https://hackernoon.com/10-data-structure-algorithms-and-programming-courses-to-crack-any-coding-interview-e1c50b30b927), I suggest you take this course to improve your System design skills. They also have a sequel now called Grokking the Advanced System Design, which enhance this great course even more.

And, if you find the Educative platform and their Grokking courses like Grokking the Modern System Design Interview, and this one then consider getting an [**Educative Subscription**](https://www.educative.io/subscription?affiliate_id=5073518643380224) which provides access to their 250+ courses for just $14.9 per month. It’s very cost-effective and great for preparing for coding interviews.

This is an advanced course to learn about Software architecture and System Design from DesignGuru.io, one of my favorite interactive learning platforms for tech interviews, particular System Design and this course is like the advanced version of their popular [_Grokking The System Design_ _Interview_](https://designgurus.org/link/84Y9hP?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdesigngurus.org%2Fcourse%3Fcourseid%3Dgrokking-the-system-design-interview) course.

Designing systems and architecting software is one of the key responsibilities of a senior software engineer. But it’s difficult to master without practice, and few people have the chance to work on large-scale projects from the ground up.

This **advanced System design course solves that problem**. It provides you a chance to dive deep into the most common types of distributed systems including key-value store, distributed messaging and streaming system, distributed file storage systems, and more.

By using actual use-cases from some of the most famous systems, you will get a look at the architecture the creators had in mind while designing the system. You will then evaluate various tradeoffs that the original developers had to consider and what prompted them to choose a certain design given their constraints.

Along the way, you will also learn about a set of [design patterns](https://medium.com/javarevisited/7-best-online-courses-to-learn-object-oriented-design-pattern-in-java-749b6399af59) that are used to solve some of the most common problems in distributed systems. These are especially handy in system design interviews.

If you have an interview coming up, or you’re interested in software design/architecture, then you can use this course to level up your system design skills and prepare better.
